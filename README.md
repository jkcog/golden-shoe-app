# Golden Shoes

This project contains a frontend React client and a backend Express server.
- To run the server, run `npm install` within the `server` directory to install the necessary dependencies, followed by `npm start` to run the app.
- Follow the same steps to run the React app from within the `client` directory.

<br />

The Express server will not be able to access the MongoDB database without access to the password.
For this reason I have deployed the server to Heroku and have set the React app to use the Heroku URL: https://desolate-spire-25441.herokuapp.com
